Target: localhost:8085

Summary of Reconnaissance and Vulnerability Scanning Results

1. Nmap Scan:
- Host: localhost (127.0.0.1)
- Port 8085/tcp is open, running Apache httpd 2.4.25 (Debian)

2. WhatWeb Technology Fingerprinting:
- Detected Apache 2.4.25 (Debian)
- Title: Welcome :: Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) v1.10 *Development*
- JavaScript detected

3. Directory and File Enumeration (Gobuster):
- Key endpoints discovered:
  - /vulnerabilities/xss_d/
  - /vulnerabilities/xss_r/
  - /vulnerabilities/fi/
  - /vulnerabilities/sqli/
  - /vulnerabilities/exec/
  - /vulnerabilities/upload/
  - /vulnerabilities/brute/
  - /vulnerabilities/sqli_blind/
  - /vulnerabilities/captcha/
  - /config/config.inc.php
  - /about.php
  - /instructions.php
  - /setup.php
  - /login.php

4. Parameter Extraction:
- Parameters were successfully extracted for several endpoints, including XSS, File Inclusion, and SQLi test points.

5. Nuclei Vulnerability Scanning:
- Endpoints tested:
  - /vulnerabilities/xss_d/?default=English (XSS)
  - /vulnerabilities/fi/?page=include.php (LFI)
  - /vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit# (SQLi)
  - /vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name=1# (XSS)
  - /about.php (Exposure)
- No vulnerabilities were detected by Nuclei using the latest templates and the provided authenticated session cookie.

Conclusion:
- The target (localhost:8085) is running DVWA on Apache 2.4.25 (Debian).
- Common web vulnerabilities (XSS, LFI, SQLi, and information exposure) were tested on key endpoints, but no issues were detected by automated scanning tools.
- Manual testing or further in-depth analysis may be required for comprehensive assessment, as DVWA is intentionally vulnerable and some issues may not be detected by automated tools.

All findings are based on the latest available templates and authenticated access.
